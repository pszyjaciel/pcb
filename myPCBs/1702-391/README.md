This is a redesign from a ploted film. <br />
The TIFF C4 files has been scanned with resolution of 600DPI. <br />

All CNC files was given as MAPE format, which I ported to the SM3000 
and finally exported as DXF in the CAM software. <br />

Reading of DXF into PADS could make a nice backgroud for further work. <br />
